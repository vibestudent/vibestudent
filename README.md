## Quick pitch
I build playgrounds for human+AI creativity. Instead of coding line-by-line, I describe, iterate, and orchestrate — using AI agents and terminal-first workflows to prototype fast and polish smarter.

## Featured — VIBEcode
VIBEcode is a fast arcade game where you match AI-generated code snippets with their descriptions. It was prototyped end-to-end with generative AI and demonstrates how AI can own UI, logic, and polish.

Try it: https://github.com/vibestudent/vibecode-game

Highlights
- Terminal-style UI with smooth, readable animations
- Streak-based scoring and progressive difficulty
- Responsive layout and dynamic audio

## Current experiments
A curated set of AI-first prototypes and tools:
- PopupKit — UI prototyped with v0 by Vercel  
- Copilot Advanced Pong — built with the VS Code Copilot Agent  
- React Calculator App — frontend prototyped with v0 by Vercel

These are learning-first projects that explore agent-driven development and creative automation.
