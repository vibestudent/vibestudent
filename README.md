### About

I’m **Vibe Student** — a developer exploring the future of **AI-assisted software creation**.  
Instead of writing code from scratch, I build by **describing, iterating, and orchestrating** with AI agents and CLI tools.

**Focus areas:**
- **AI-driven development** — projects built with **v0 by Vercel**, **VS Code Copilot Agent**, **Claude**, **Cursor**, and **ChatGPT**  
- **Terminal-first workflows** — automation and customization using **Ghostty**, **Zsh**, **Neovim (LazyVim)**, **LazyGit**, and **Starship**  
- **Agent-driven workflows** — making development faster, smarter, and more creative through AI

### Experiments

Every project here is an **AI-generated prototype** — built through conversation, iteration, and curiosity.  
They’re educational, experimental, and sometimes imperfect — but they all explore what’s possible when humans and AI build together.  

**Highlights:**
- PopupKit – UI built entirely with v0 by Vercel  
- C-to-Assembly Transpiler – built with VS Code Copilot Agent  
- React Calculator App – a full AI-generated frontend project  
- Various CLI scripts, prompt frameworks, and terminal automations

> These aren’t about proving I can code — they’re about showing what coding becomes when AI joins the workflow.

### Philosophy

> I don’t code line by line.  
> I *vibecode* — blending AI intuition with human direction.  
> The goal isn’t perfection. It’s exploration.
