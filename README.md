### ⚡ About

I’m **Vibe Student** — a developer exploring the future of **AI-assisted software creation**.  
Instead of writing code from scratch, I build by **describing, iterating, and orchestrating** with AI agents and CLI tools.

My focus:  
- 🧠 **AI-driven development** — building projects with GenAI tools like **v0 by Vercel**, **VS Code Copilot Agent**, **Claude**, **Cursor**, and **ChatGPT**.  
- 💻 **Terminal-first workflows** — I design, automate, and customize my environment using **Ghostty**, **Zsh**, **Neovim (LazyVim)**, **LazyGit**, **Starship**, and more.  
- ⚙️ **CLI automation & agent workflows** — making development faster, smarter, and more creative through the terminal.

### 🧪 Experiments

Every project here is an **AI-generated prototype** — built through conversation, iteration, and curiosity.  
They’re educational, experimental, and sometimes imperfect — but they all explore what’s possible when humans and AI build together.  

Some highlights:
- **PopupKit** – UI built entirely with v0 by Vercel  
- **C-to-Assembly Transpiler** – AI-generated tool built via VS Code Copilot Agent  
- **React Calculator App** – a full AI-driven frontend project  
- Various **CLI scripts**, **prompt frameworks**, and **terminal automations**

> These aren’t about proving I can code — they’re about showing what coding becomes when AI joins the workflow.
