## Quick Pitch
I build **playgrounds for human+AI creativity**. Rather than coding line-by-line, I describe, iterate, and orchestrate using AI agents and terminal-first workflows — prototyping fast and refining smarter.

---

## Featured Project — [VIBEcode](https://github.com/vibestudent/vibecode-game)
**VIBEcode** is a fast arcade game where players match **AI-generated code snippets** with their descriptions. The project was **prototyped end-to-end with generative AI**, demonstrating how AI can take ownership of UI, logic, and polish.

**Highlights:**
- Terminal-style UI with smooth, readable animations  
- Streak-based scoring and progressive difficulty  
- Responsive layout with dynamic audio  

**Try it:** [GitHub: VIBEcode](https://github.com/vibestudent/vibecode-game)

## Current Experiments
A curated selection of AI-first prototypes and tools:

- [PopupKit](https://github.com/vibestudent/popupkit) — UI prototyped entirely with **v0 by Vercel**  
- [Copilot Advanced Pong](https://github.com/vibestudent/copilot-advanced-pong) — built using **VS Code Copilot Agent**  
- [React Calculator App](https://github.com/vibestudent/react-calculator-app) — frontend prototyped with **v0 by Vercel**  

These are **learning-first projects** that explore agent-driven development, creative automation, and AI-assisted workflows.
