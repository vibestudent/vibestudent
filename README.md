> AI-first prototypes — fast, focused, and functional.  
> Where terminal workflows meet agent-led builds.

## 🧠 Quick Pitch
I build **playgrounds for human+AI creativity**.  
Instead of coding line by line, I **describe, iterate, and orchestrate** — using AI agents and terminal-first workflows to **prototype fast** and **refine smarter**.

### Overview
**VIBEcode** is an **arcade-style coding game** where players match AI-generated code snippets with their meanings.  
It’s a hands-on experiment in **AI-assisted UI + logic design**, prototyped with generative workflows and refined manually for polish.

### Features
- 🖥️ **Terminal-inspired UI** with smooth animations  
- ⚡ **Streak-based scoring** and adaptive difficulty  
- 🔊 **Dynamic audio** and responsive layout  
- 🤖 **Fully AI-prototyped, human-refined**
