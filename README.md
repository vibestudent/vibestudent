## 🧠 Quick Pitch
I build **playgrounds for human+AI creativity**.  
Instead of coding line by line, I **describe, iterate, and orchestrate** — using AI agents and terminal-first workflows to **prototype fast** and **refine smarter**.

## 🎮 Featured Project — [VIBEcode](https://github.com/vibestudent/vibecode-game)
**VIBEcode** is an **arcade-style coding game** where players match AI-generated snippets to their meanings.  
It’s an experiment in **AI-assisted UI + logic design**, built from concept to polish through generative workflows.

**Highlights**
- 🖥️ Terminal-inspired UI with smooth animations  
- ⚡ Streak-based scoring and adaptive difficulty  
- 🔊 Dynamic audio + responsive layout  
- 🤖 Fully AI-prototyped, human-refined

## 🧩 Current Experiments
Exploring **AI-first workflows** and **agentic development tools**:

- [PopupKit](https://github.com/vibestudent/popupkit) — UI prototyped entirely with **v0 by Vercel**  
- [Copilot Advanced Pong](https://github.com/vibestudent/copilot-advanced-pong) — built using **Copilot Agent** inside VS Code  
- [React Calculator App](https://github.com/vibestudent/react-calculator-app) — front-end generated with **v0 by Vercel**

Each project focuses on **hands-on exploration** — testing how AI can collaborate, automate, and accelerate the dev process.
