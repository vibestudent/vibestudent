### About

I’m **Vibe Student** — a developer exploring the future of **AI-assisted software creation**.  
Instead of writing code line by line, I build by **describing, iterating, and orchestrating** with AI agents and terminal-first workflows.

**Focus areas:**
- **AI-driven development** — projects built with **v0 by Vercel**, **VS Code Copilot Agent**, **Claude**, **Cursor**, and **ChatGPT**  
- **Terminal-first workflows** — automation and customization using **Ghostty**, **Zsh**, **Neovim (LazyVim)**, **LazyGit**, and **Starship**  
- **Agent-driven workflows** — making development faster, smarter, and more creative through AI

### Featured Project: VIBEcode

**VIBEcode** is a fast-paced arcade game where players match AI-generated code snippets to their descriptions.  
This project was built **entirely with generative AI**, including UI, animations, game logic, and interactions.

**Key Features:**
- Terminal-style code display with smooth animations
- Progressive difficulty and streak-based scoring
- Dynamic sound effects and responsive design
- Fully AI-assisted development workflow

**Try it here:** [VIBEcode on GitHub](https://github.com/vibestudent/vibecode-game)

This project embodies my philosophy: *describing, iterating, and orchestrating with AI to build functional, engaging experiences.*

### Experiments

All projects on this profile are **AI-generated prototypes** — designed to explore the possibilities of human-AI collaboration.  
They are educational, experimental, and demonstrate iterative, AI-assisted development workflows.

**Highlights:**
- [PopupKit](https://github.com/vibestudent/popupkit) – UI built entirely with v0 by Vercel  
- [Copilot Advanced Pong](https://github.com/vibestudent/copilot-advanced-pong) – built with VS Code Copilot Agent  
- [React Calculator App](https://github.com/vibestudent/react-calculator-app) – full AI-generated frontend using v0 by Vercel  
- Various CLI scripts, prompt frameworks, and terminal automations

These projects emphasize **what coding becomes when AI joins the workflow**, rather than traditional coding skill alone.

### Philosophy

I don’t code line by line.  
I *vibecode* — blending AI intuition with human direction.  
The goal is not perfection, but exploration and innovation.
